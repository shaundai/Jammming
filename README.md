## Reflection

This 3-week project was the capstone of my Codecademy React coursework.  Jammming applied all of my learnings about components and separation of concerns, lifecycle methods, JSX, and connecting an API to one front-end web app.

The most difficult part about this project was calling the Spotify API.  I learned a lot about authentication as I worked to make this app pull back search results from my own Spotify.

Overall, building Jammming helped me to get a solid grasp on state, stateless vs stateful components, passing down props, and when (and why) to create separate components for different parts of my app.  I now feel confident with React fundamentals; all of my learnings here made me a much better React developer.

Learning to call an API and GET and POST data has made me dangerous with connecting my apps with APIs!
